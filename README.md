# midi-sustain-pedal-controlled-by-a-game-controller

I need a sustain pedal to use with a MIDI keyboard, but I don’t have one.

I once created iPedal which allows me to use my iPad as a foot pedal:

...but newer iPads seem to have better screens now and so my new [iPedal](https://github.com/dtinth/ipedal) doesn’t react to my foot very well.

But I have a game controller.
